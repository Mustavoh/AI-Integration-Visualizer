# AI Decision Visualizer

You can test it yourself here :)

## Let AI Make Your Decisions

This app shows how AI can control parts of your program with simple yes/no choices. Ask any question, and watch as the AI thinks and lights up its answer.

## What It Does

- Ask any yes/no question in the text box
- AI processes your question
- Visual feedback shows the answer (red for NO, green for YES)
- Cool particle background adds visual interest

## How It Works

The app sends your question to an AI (Groq) and tells it to only answer YES or NO. When the answer comes back, the app lights up the matching box to show you the result.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Set up your Groq API key
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Ask away!

## Built With

- Next.js
- React
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS
- Groq AI

## Why It's Cool

Instead of just showing text, this app uses visual cues (glowing boxes) to display AI decisions. This same idea can work for any program where you want AI to make simple choices.
